## Learning ggplot2  
Also working with Github for this  

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, mpg}
mpg
```

```{r, practice.plot}
myplot <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

myplot

# above can also write like this, where you include your aesthetic mapping in your geom calls
myplot2 <- ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

myplot2
# but you don't want to do it because it makes things confusing. 
# remember that ggplot2 builds off previous calls and you want to do that.
```
