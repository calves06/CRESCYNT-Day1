## Learning ggplot2  
Also working with Github for this  

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, mpg}
mpg
```

```{r, practice.plot}
myplot <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

myplot

# above can also write like this, where you include your aesthetic mapping in your geom calls
myplot2 <- ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

myplot2
# but you don't want to do it because it makes things confusing. 
# remember that ggplot2 builds off previous calls and you want to do that.
```


```{r, alpha.dots}
myplot <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) #darker plots have 0.4 transparency dots stacked on top of each other

myplot
```


```{r, colored.dots}
myplot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+
  geom_point(aes(color=class))

myplot

# can also write like:
myplot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))+
  geom_point()

myplot
```

```{r, shapes}
myplot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))+
  geom_point()

myplot # we just encountered a problem b/c there are only 6 shapes but there are 7 classes; it then removed rows

# now map back to color b/c shapes look weird
myplot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))+
  geom_point()

myplot
```

## **Practice Activity:** Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cty` with different sized points representing each `class` and different colors for each `fuel` type

```{r, newplot}
newplot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x= hwy, y = cty, size = class, color=fl))+
  geom_point()

newplot #got warning message about using size for a discrete variable; not advised!

```


```{r}
plot3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color="blue") #colors can also be numbers (w/o "")

plot3
```


```{r}

```
